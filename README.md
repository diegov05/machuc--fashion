# machuc--fashion

This is a fashion webpage full frontend project although I'm planning to add some backend features such as shopping carts, etc.
Languagues used are HTML, JS with JQuery and CSS with SASS.
This is the more vanilla-ish version of the project because I'll be doing a MERN version of the project.
Webpage design: https://www.figma.com/file/E821PFvB0itZ28ByVfZHLe/machuc%C3%A1-fashion
